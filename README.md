Just going to write relevant information here.

---

I hope to optimise the process of updating these solutions, because currently I am \
&rarr; Going into my Notion databse \
&rarr; Exporting each individual solution (they're kept in gallery boards, I can't seem to export them all at once) \
&rarr; Unzipping the markdowns \
&rarr; Renaming the markdowns 

I am particularly bothered by the renaming. You can see if you check the history, but for some reason the files have extra characters in the title after exporting. I'm going to see if I can find a way to shortern this process to a maybe two step in the future. To preserve the life of this respository (and my sanity).
