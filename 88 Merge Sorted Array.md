# 88. Merge Sorted Array

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/

```java
class Solution {
	public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
		for(int i = 0, j = m; i<n; i++){
			nums1[j++] = nums2[i];
		}
		Arrays.sort(nums1);
	}
}
```

So like, you just start at the end of the first array, cause there are just 0â€™s as placeholders there. You then just iterate from there (m), and use that Arrays.sort, cause big brain.
